    * \struct Answer Answer.h
    * Represents the answer of an examinee to a Question as a vector of strings.
    * 
    * For most questions, the examinee may just provide a single string as an
    * answer, so the vector will be of size 1. If the expected answer is more
    * complex in structure (for example, mapping some elements together or drawing
    * something), the answer can be encoded as a sequence of strings, and so the
    * vector is likely to have a size greater than 1.
    * 
    * The Answer class implements a virtual method isEqualTo() that compares an
    * Answer with another one and which can be overriden in derived classes. This
    * method is important, as it is this method that is called to determine whether
    * an Answer is correct for a particular Question (it must be among the
    * Question's set of correct answers). By default, two answers are said to be
    * equal if they contain exactly the same string elements and in the same order.
    * Derived classes might change this behavior and adapt to other Answer
    * structures (e.g. when the order does not matter for the Answer to be correct).
