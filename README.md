**OpenTesting** is an open-source framework for standardized testing. It enables academic and business institutions to create their own skill and knowledge tests while providing free and unlimited resources to candidates to practice for them. It can also help you design an informal quiz just for you and your friends for free.

**OpenTesting** features a powerful question engine that can turn a single abstract model like the following:

```C++
"[1:1] [2:1] for having [2:2] together what are ostensibly [3:1] [2:3] studies into a [2:4]"
```

Into thousands of questions like this:

    <a href="https://github.com/mlaasri/OpenTesting">
        <img style="width:90%" src="sample-question.svg">
    </a>
</p>

Each with its own correct answer.

The engine is capable of generating so many questions that it makes it impossible for rote memorization strategies to succeed. Therefore it enables institutions to publish test banks out in the open (hence the name *OpenTesting*) without compromising the quality of their tests. This is how **OpenTesting** helps pave the way towards complete transparency and equal access to free practice resources in standardized testing. Come and join the ride!



## Components

**OpenTesting** is comprised of the following components:

- `otlib`, the OpenTesting Library. This component is a C++17, single-header library that defines the core classes and methods for representing questions and question generators. The library features OpenTesting's core engine for generating questions. It is entirely written in C++ with minimal dependencies. 

- ... (more to come)



## Installation

In its current version, **OpenTesting** only features one component, the `otlib` C++ library, which is meant for developers. If you want to compile and use `otlib`, simply clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/mlaasri/OpenTesting.git
```

and compile all the *.cpp files in the `otlib` folder with your favorite compiler. Once compiled and linked to your project, use the library's single header `"otlib.h"` located in the `otlib/include` folder to quickly start exploring `otlib`.

### First program

As a first example, you should be able to compile and run the following code which uses **OpenTesting**'s engine to generate simple questions asking the capital of a country:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "otlib.h"

int main()
{
    /* Creating a question with a placeholder '[1]' to be replaced later */
    auto promptInitializer = std::make_unique<OT::PromptInitializationUnit>();
    promptInitializer->addPrompt("What is the capital of [1]?");

    /* Defining what '[1]' can be replaced with */
    auto countryFiller = std::make_unique<OT::TokenReplacementUnit>();
    countryFiller->addToken("[1]");
    countryFiller->addReplacementString("Morocco");
    countryFiller->addReplacementString("France");
    countryFiller->addReplacementString("the United States");

    /* Initializing the engine to generate questions with the above objects */
    OT::QuestionGenerator<OT::Question> questionGenerator;
    auto& factory = questionGenerator.appendNewTable().appendNewFactory();
    factory.append(std::move(promptInitializer));
    factory.append(std::move(countryFiller));

    /* Generating all possible questions */
    for (const std::string& key : questionGenerator.getKeys())
        std::cout << questionGenerator.generate(key)->prompt << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The console should print:

```console
What is the capital of France?
What is the capital of the United States?
What is the capital of Morocco?
```

This sample code generates very simple questions and is mostly aimed at testing your installation. Once you get it running, you should try the code from the example below where the engine is used to create multiple-choice questions.

### Example with multiple-choice questions

The following code generates multiple-choice questions about geography using **OpenTesting**'s engine:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "otlib.h"

int main()
{
    /* Creating a question with a placeholder '[1]' to be replaced later */
    auto prompt = std::make_unique<OT::PromptInitializationUnit>();
    prompt->addPrompt("Which country is on the same continent as [1]?");

    /* Defining what '[1]' can be replaced with */
    auto country = std::make_unique<OT::TokenReplacementUnit>();
    country->addToken("[1]");
    country->addReplacementString("France");
    country->addReplacementString("Italy");

    /* Listing some correct and incorrect options */
    auto options = std::make_unique<OT::OptionSelectionUnit>();
    options->appendCorrectOption("Spain");
    options->appendCorrectOption("Germany");
    options->appendIncorrectOption("USA");
    options->appendIncorrectOption("Morocco");
    options->appendIncorrectOption("Japan");
    options->appendIncorrectOption("India");
    options->setIncorrectSelectionSize(3);

    /* Initializing the engine to generate questions with the above objects */
    OT::QuestionGenerator<OT::MultipleChoiceQuestion> questionGenerator;
    auto& factory = questionGenerator.appendNewTable().appendNewFactory();
    factory.append(std::make_unique<OT::WrapperUnit<OT::Question, OT::MultipleChoiceQuestion>>(std::move(prompt)));
    factory.append(std::make_unique<OT::WrapperUnit<OT::Question, OT::MultipleChoiceQuestion>>(std::move(country)));
    factory.append(std::move(options));

    /* Generating all possible questions */
    for (const std::string& key : questionGenerator.getKeys())
    {
        auto question = questionGenerator.generateAndCast<OT::MultipleChoiceQuestion>(key);
        std::cout << question->prompt << std::endl << std::endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
            std::cout << "(" << std::string("ABCD")[i] << ") " << question->optionGroups[0].options[i] << std::endl;
        std::cout << std::endl << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The console should print 32 multiple-choice questions like this:

```console
Which country is on the same continent as France?

(A) Morocco
(B) Germany
(C) USA
(D) Japan


Which country is on the same continent as Italy?

(A) Japan
(B) Spain
(C) USA
(D) India

...
```

Where the prompt and answer choices have been randomized by the engine.

This example generates simple multiple-choice questions based on a few constraints, but it only shows the tip of the iceberg. As you experiment with the engine, you will quickly see that things get much more interesting when you provide it with more customization and rules.
